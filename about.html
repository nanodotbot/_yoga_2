        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>Practicing sports has always been part of my life. Growing up in Hungary I did many different types of sports such as swimming, gymnastics, handball, basketball and athletics. During my teenage years and my young adulthood, I engaged in body building, aerobic, Pilates, CrossFit and weightlifting to keep myself fit and healthy. I also participated in many tournaments during my childhood.</p>

        <p>Due to some personal changes in my life I became anxious about my future. Every day I worried about this uncertainty. One day I passed by a yoga studio and decided to join a class to try something new. The first class was like magic for me; I didn't know what the practice was about and I just followed the instructor. During the class I didn't think about my worries and it felt very good and relaxing. My mind was able to switch off, which was an amazing experience – so I decided to keep going back. During this time, I only focused on the physical practice. I even signed up for a four-month beginners' course only to learn the poses.</p>
            
        <p>When I moved to London from Hungary, I couldn't practice yoga because I was overwhelmed with the busy lifestyle and the language barrier. After a few years of living in London I started yoga again and it quickly became my favourite activity. I once again mainly focused on physical practice and I wanted to be able to do all those advanced poses, I saw on Instagram. I practiced as much I was able to fit into my busy days. During this time yoga changed my mindset and I wanted to know what it was and why the change of mind is happening, so I signed up for the 200 hours Yoga Teacher Training at YogaLondon.</p>
            
        <p>The course opened a door for me for the world of yoga. The more I have been practicing the more I have been learning and reading about it, the more I became fascinated in how beautiful the practice of yoga is. Yoga helps us to live a balanced life. Yoga is complex – for me it is a learning process for life. Learning and practicing can't be rushed and realising this, has made me more patience with myself. Today, yoga for me is not just physical practice, it helps me to let go and handle difficult situations, it brings harmony and balance to the soul and body, it helps me to be present and aware in my everyday life.</p>
